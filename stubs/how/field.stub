<comment>Description:</comment>
You can create new field types to use in contenttypes.
This is useful when you want to create something like a colorpicker.

<comment>Create a new Field:</comment>
GÃ¼nther makes it really easy to create a new field class and template.
Just execute 'guenther make:field <Name>'.

Example:
'guenther make:field ColorpickerField'

<comment>Register a Field:</comment>
Every field must be registered in your extension class.

Example:
public function registerFields()
{
    return [
        new Field\ColorpickerField(),
    ];
}
